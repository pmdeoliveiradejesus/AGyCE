--- DICOPT: Terminating...
--- DICOPT: Stopped on MAXCYCLES

      The search was stopped because the major iteration limit
      was reached. This limit can be reset with the DICOPT
      option MAXCYCLES.

--- DICOPT: No integer solution

      No integer solution was found. The relaxed NLP solution
      will be reported.
